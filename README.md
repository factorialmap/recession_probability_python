# Exercise with simple recession probability model using two variables USREC and T10Y3M with python code

There is a market behavior that believes that at each turn in the yield curve, which is the difference between 10-year bonds vs 3-months treasury bills, the probability of recession increases. 
Histsorically, we have only four observations describing this phenomenon, which makes it very fragile to establish a cause-and-effect relationship, however, considering that the economy as a social phenomenon, 
we decided to make a machine learning model with the following goals:

- Better understand the phenomenon by colleting information as it happens
- Collet data from the FED using Python API
- Create machine learning models using python code.
- Create probability model production web interface

The objective of this exercise is not to make market decisions, but to better understand the phenomenon and practice critical thinking about tools for collecting, pre-processing, developing, and publishing 
machine learnig models using in a python environment.
